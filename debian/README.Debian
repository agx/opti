iptables-optimizer
------------------

 iptables-optimizer is now written as a shell
 script, which functions are sourced from
 another file, reason is to make testing with
 shunit2 possible. The shell excutes the
 functions, one of them calls the python,
 which works with  python2.7 and python3.4
 as tested in sources with tox, see tox.ini
 in the source package.
